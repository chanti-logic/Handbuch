	\item \PYTHON{readColor(...)}: This method retrieves the color values from the sensor.
	
	It can either read just the color values or the color values along with the ambient light intensity.
	
	\medskip
	
	To read only the color values:
	
	\PYTHON{int r, g, b;}
	
	\PYTHON{APDS.readColor(r, g, b);}
	
	\medskip
	
	The variables \PYTHON{r}, \PYTHON{g}, and \PYTHON{b} will contain the updated color values. The value range is $0, 1, 2, \ldots, 255$.

	\PYTHON{APDS.readColor(r, g, b, a);}
	
	\medskip
	
	The variables \PYTHON{r}, \PYTHON{g}, and \PYTHON{b} will contain the updated color values, while \PYTHON{a} will contain the ambient light intensity. The value range is $0, 1, 2, \ldots, 255$.

\section{Simple Function Tests}

The following code examples can be used to test and try out all functions of the APDS-9960.

\subsection{Example Color Detection}

The library  \PYTHON{Arduino\_APDS9960} includes an example code demonstrating how to perform color detection with the sensor APDS-9960 on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. This example also tests the ambient light sensor, as both functionalities rely on the same underlying technology. The measured color channel intensities (Red, Green, and Blue) are displayed in the Serial Monitor for real-time observation.

The sensor APDS-9960 enables accurate RGB color detection by measuring the intensity of red, green, and blue light reflected from an object. These values can be visualized in the Serial Plotter, allowing users to track changes in color intensity over time through a graphical representation. This feature is particularly useful for applications that require real-time color monitoring or dynamic light adjustments.


\subsection{Example Color Detection - Manual}

\Mynote{to do}


\subsection{Setting Up the Color Sensor Measurement Program}

To begin the process of creating the color sensor measurement program, open the Arduino Cloud Editor and navigate to the "Libraries" tab. Search for the "Arduino-APDS9960" library and download it. Afterward, click on "More info" to access the GitHub repository, where several examples are provided.

Next, connect the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense to the computer, ensuring that the Cloud Editor detects both the board and the corresponding port. If the board is not automatically recognized, follow the instructions to install the necessary plugin to enable the editor to detect the board. Confirm that the correct port is selected. Finally, upload the program to the Arduino, and by opening the serial monitor, the measured values will be recorded in the Arduino IDE.

\subsection{Example }Color Detection - Code}

First, serial communication is started with \PYTHON{Serial.begin(9600)} to send data to the computer. The command  \PYTHON{APDS.begin()} initializes the sensor and in the event of a potential error, an error message is output via the serial interface.

\bigskip



\bigskip

The code operates within the function \PYTHON{loop()} of a sketch to continuously read and display color values from the APDS-9960 sensor. Initially, it checks if a color reading is available by using the method \PYTHON{APDS.colorAvailable()}. If no reading is available, the program briefly pauses for 5 milliseconds to avoid excessive CPU usage. Once a reading is ready, the method \PYTHON{APDS.readColor(r, g, b)} retrieves the color data and stores the red, green, and blue values in the respective variables. These values are then printed to the Serial Monitor, labeled clearly as ``r'', ``g'', and ``b''. A one-second delay is added before the program repeats the loop, allowing for clear intervals between consecutive readings.




\subsection{Example Color Detection - File}

}


\subsection{Proximity}

A simple code for testing the proximity sensor is also provided by the library. The proximity sensor is designed for measuring distances of up to 100mm.

\subsection{Proximity - Manual}

Open the Arduino Cloud Editor and navigate to the Libraries tab. In the search bar, search for the library \PYTHON{Arduino\_APDS9960}. Once located, open the Examples section within the library and select the sketch ``ProximitySensor''.
\smallskip
Connect the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense to the computer. Check that the Cloud Editor recognizes the board by verifying if both the board and port are listed in the dropdown menu.

\subsection{Example Proximity - Code}

First, serial communication is started with \PYTHON{Serial.begin(9600)} to send data to the computer. The method \PYTHON{APDS.begin()}  initializes the sensor and in the event of a potential error, an error message is output via the serial interface.


\bigskip


The code operates within the function \PYTHON{loop()}  of a sketch to continuously read and display proximity values from the sensor APDS-9960. It begins by checking if a proximity reading is available using the method \PYTHON{APDS.proximityAvailable()}. If a reading is ready, the method \PYTHON{APDS.readProximity()} retrieves the proximity value, where \PYTHON{0} indicates a close object, \PYTHON{255} indicates a distant object, and \PYTHON{-1} signals an error in reading. This proximity value is then printed to the Serial Monitor. A delay of 100 milliseconds is added before the program repeats the loop, ensuring a brief interval between consecutive readings.

}

\subsection{Gesture Detection}
\subsection{Example Gesture Detection}

The library \FILE{Arduino\_APDS9960} also provides an example sketch demonstrating gesture detection with the sensor APDS-9960 on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. Some LED feedback signals have been programmed to provide quick visual feedback.

\subsection{Example Gesture Detection - Manual}

\Mynote{to do}


\subsection{Example Gesture Detection - Code}

In this example sketch, the library \FILE{Arduino\_APDS9960} is integrated first and then the setup is created. In addition, the LED pins are configured so that they behave as outputs.


\bigskip

After that, serial communication is initialized, and the program verifies whether the sensor is correctly initialized using \PYTHON{APDS.begin()}. If initialization fails, an error message is printed. The gesture sensitivity can be adjusted via \PYTHON{APDS.setGestureSensitivity(value)}, where values range from 1 to 100, affecting detection accuracy and sensitivity. The sketch sets a default sensitivity and signals the start of gesture detection by turning off the RGB LEDs with \PYTHON{digitalWrite(LEDR, HIGH)}, \PYTHON{digitalWrite(LEDG, HIGH)}, and \PYTHON{digitalWrite(LEDB, HIGH)}.

In the function \PYTHON{loop()}, the code continuously checks for available gestures using \PYTHON{APDS.gestureAvailable()}. When a gesture is detected, it is read using \PYTHON{APDS.readGesture()} and interpreted within a \PYTHON{switch} statement. Each gesture corresponds to specific LED behavior:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \PYTHON{GESTURE\_UP}: The red LED is briefly turned on, then off after a 1-second delay.
	\item \PYTHON{GESTURE\_DOWN}: The green LED is briefly turned on, then off after a 1-second delay.
	\item \PYTHON{GESTURE\_LEFT}: The blue LED is briefly turned on, then off after a 1-second delay.
	\item \PYTHON{GESTURE\_RIGHT}: All LEDs are turned on simultaneously, then off after a 1-second delay.
\end{itemize}

The \PYTHON{default} case ensures no action if an undefined gesture is detected.

}

\subsection{Troubleshoot}


Errors in color detection can be caused by insufficient lighting in the room. Please ensure that the environment is bright enough for the color detection function.


\section{Calibration Color Detection}

\section{Calibration Color Detection}

Due to variations in environmental light conditions and the sensitivity of the sensor, calibration is required to ensure accurate color detection. This section outlines the calibration process using a standard color chart under constant lighting conditions. To carry out the calibration, the Arduino, a connection cable (USB A to USB Micro), and a laptop or computer with the appropriate Arduino development environment are required.

\medskip

The proximity and gesture feature is pre-configured and factory-calibrated to detect proximity and gesture at a distance of 100mm, eliminating the need for customer calibration.
\cite{BroadcomAPDS9960:2024}

\subsection{Calibration Setup}

A standardized color chart is used, which provides reference values for perfect red, green, and blue under constant lighting conditions. The RGB values from the sensor are read as raw, uncalibrated data, which must be normalized to a standard range (0–255) for accurate color detection.\Mynote{citation, picture}

\subsection{Step 1: Measuring Reference Values}

The first step in the calibration process is to measure the raw sensor values for each primary color (red, green, and blue) using the standardized color chart. By placing the color chart in front of the sensor and reading the raw RGB values, we can establish the maximum possible sensor readings for each color channel.

\[
\text{RawRed} = \max(R_{\text{measured}})
\]
\[
\text{RawGreen} = \max(G_{\text{measured}})
\]
\[
\text{RawBlue} = \max(B_{\text{measured}})
\]

These maximum values are obtained by positioning the chart at a fixed distance of one centimeter and ensuring constant light intensity.

\subsection{Step 2: Normalizing the Sensor Values}
Once the maximum sensor readings for red, green, and blue are obtained, the raw sensor data is normalized to a 0-255 scale. This ensures that the sensor's readings correspond to standard RGB values. The following formula is used for normalization:

\[
R_{\text{calibrated}} = \frac{R_{\text{raw}}}{\text{RawRed}} \times 255
\]
\[
G_{\text{calibrated}} = \frac{G_{\text{raw}}}{\text{RawGreen}} \times 255
\]
\[
B_{\text{calibrated}} = \frac{B_{\text{raw}}}{\text{RawBlue}} \times 255
\]

Where:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $R_{\text{raw}}, G_{\text{raw}}, B_{\text{raw}}$ are the raw sensor values for each channel.
	\item $\text{RawRed}, \text{RawGreen}, \text{RawBlue}$ are the maximum measured values from the standard color chart.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Step 3: Implementing the Calibration in Code}

The normalization process is implemented directly in the Arduino code to adjust the sensor's readings. To begin calibration, open the Serial Monitor, enter ``OK'' in the command line, and press Enter to confirm. The following steps will then be explained through text output.

\bigskip

After the user initiates the calibration by typing ``OK'' into the Serial Monitor, the sketch starts. The sketch guides the user through the calibration of red, green, and blue colors, with each phase confirmed by entering ``OK''. The pins for the RGB LEDs are defined, and variables store the maximum calibration values for each color. Status variables control the sequence, ensuring each phase is completed before moving to the next. These maximum values are later used for accurate color detection in the Application code.

\bigskip


The following code section begins by initializing serial communication at a baud rate of 9600, enabling interaction through the serial monitor. Next, it sets the RGB LED pins as outputs and turns on all LEDs to create white light, which helps capture accurate color measurements. The code then initializes the sensor APDS-9960, checking for successful setup. If the sensor fails to initialize, an error message is printed, and the program halts. If successful, a message confirms initialization and prompts the user to type ``OK'' in the serial monitor to proceed with the calibration process explanation.

\bigskip

The next code segment in the loop first checks if the user has entered ``OK'' to start the calibration process. After confirmation, it displays an explanation and instructions. After showing the explanation, it waits for the user to confirm by typing ``OK'' again, which then initiates the red color calibration by prompting the user to place the red chart in front of the sensor. The loop pauses at each step until the user confirms.

\Mynote{Screen shot?}

\bigskip

Each color calibration starts after the user types ``OK'' in the Serial Monitor. The sketch measures the highest detected value for each color over 10 seconds and sets it as the calibration maximum. After all colors are calibrated, it displays the final maximum values for red, green, and blue in the Serial Monitor, completing the process. The \PYTHON{maxRed}, \PYTHON{maxGreen}, and \PYTHON{maxBlue} values can later be entered into the application sketch to apply the calibration to the sketch.


\subsection{Calibration File}

The sketch can be found at

	\ArduinoExternal{}{../../Code/Nano33BLESense/APDS9960/APDS9960Calibration/APDS9960Calibration.ino}
}


\subsection{Step 4: Validating the Calibration}

To ensure the calibration is successful, the sensor readings should be tested again using the standard color chart. The calibrated values for red, green, and blue should be close to 255 for the respective pure colors on the chart. If the readings deviate significantly, further adjustment of the maximum reference values may be necessary.

\bigskip

The calibration of the sensor APDS-9960 is essential for accurate RGB detection. By using a standard color chart and constant lighting conditions, the sensor's raw values can be normalized to provide consistent and reliable color readings. This process can be further refined by adjusting for specific environmental factors or sensor placement.


\section{Tests}

\section{Simple Application}

Similarly, by following all the steps for uploading and compiling the sketch we can see the results of sensor APDS-9960  on Serial Monitor, too. For seeing the different output, we can change the input for the sensor too, e.g: for color detection we can switch the colors, for gesture detection we can also switch the gestures, and for proximity also do the same. The resulted output as shown in the figure.  \ref{fig:2}

We can also run the single funcnality of this sensor too, e.g; if we just need to capture the color of product, we can also run the color detection program. It depends upon the application and we can implement our application and modify the code as per our desire results.
