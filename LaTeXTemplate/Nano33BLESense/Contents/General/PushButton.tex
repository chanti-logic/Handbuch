\section{General}

A push button is a simple switch mechanism used to control various devices and processes. It is typically made of hard materials like plastic or metal.
The surface of a push button is designed to be easily depressed or pushed by the human finger or hand. When you press a push button, it either closes or opens an electrical circuit. 

In industrial and commercial applications, push buttons can be linked together so that pressing one button releases another. Emergency stop buttons, often with large mushroom-shaped heads, enhance safety in machines and equipment. Pilot lights are sometimes added to push buttons to draw attention and provide feedback when the button is pressed. Color-coding is common to associate push buttons with their specific functions (e.g., red for stopping, green for starting). \cite{DIN:13850}

\section{Built-in Push Button}

The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense features an onboard push button. This button is a simple electrical switch that can be activated by pressing it. When you press the button, it completes an electrical circuit. The push button is designed for user interaction and can be used for various purposes.

The built-in button \PYTHON{BUTTON\_B} is connected with pin 11.\index{Pin!Pin 11} Using the function \PYTHON{pinMode(BUTTON\_PIN, INPUT\_PULLUP)} the pin is declared as an input. As can be seen in the sketch, pressing the button can be used to trigger actions; typical actions include switching on an LED, changing modes, or initiating sensor readings.
Overall, the push button provides a convenient way to interact with the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and create responsive projects. \cite{Arduino:2023a,Arduino:2023,ArduinoNano33Manual:2022}

\section{Specification}

The built-in button is a small white button  and connected to pin 11.\index{Pin!Pin 11}

\begin{description}
    \item [Built-in Button:] \PYTHON{BUTTON\_B =  11u}
\end{description}

If the pin is declared as input in the function \PYTHON{setup}, then it can be used.

%\Mynote{cite data sheet, power consumption?}

The pin 11 must be defined as an input in the function \PYTHON{setup} by setting \PYTHON{pinMode (11, INPUT\_PULLUP)}, otherwise the button cannot be read.

\medskip 


The pin 11 can also be used otherwise. Then the button is not in use. \cite{Arduino:2023a,Arduino:2023,ArduinoNano33Manual:2022}

\section{Simple Code}


As soon as the button is connected, it can be used. It is not necessary to install a special library. Programming takes place in two steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item In the first step, the pin is configured in the function \PYTHON{setup}:
    
    {
        \captionof{code}{Defining the built-in button's pin as an input.}
        \begin{Arduino}
            pinMode(BUTTON_B, INPUT_PULLUP)   
        \end{Arduino}
    }
    \item In the second step, the button can be used in the function \PYTHON{loop}. To read in the value, use the function \PYTHON{digitalRead}:
    
    {
        \captionof{code}{Read the built-in button's state}
        \begin{Arduino}
            buttonState = digitalRead(BUTTON_B);
        \end{Arduino}
    }
    
\end{enumerate}




\section{Tests}


The simplest test is the flashing of an LED for 2 seconds, if the button is pressed, see sketch \ref{Nano:BuiltinButtonTest}.

\section{Interrupt Function on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense}


An interrupt is a function that allows the microcontroller on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense to immediately respond to an external event, such as pressing a button, without the need for the program to continuously check for that event. Normally, in a program, the microcontroller would repeatedly check if a button is pressed by running through a loop, which consumes processing power and can slow down other tasks. This is not efficient, especially when the program needs to perform other actions at the same time.

With an interrupt, the program can continue running other tasks, and only when the specified event (like a button press) occurs, the program is temporarily paused to execute a special function known as the \menu{Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)}. The ISR is a small, efficient function designed to handle the event, such as changing a variable or triggering another action. After the ISR is executed, the program returns to where it left off, continuing its normal operation.

Using interrupts in this way helps make the program more efficient and responsive, as it doesn't waste time constantly checking for events and can focus on other tasks until something important happens. This is especially useful for real-time applications where quick responses to external events are necessary, such as in embedded systems, robotics, or sensor monitoring.



\section{Simple Application}



This code sketch \ref{Nano:TestButtonInterrupt} shows how to use an interrupt to control the built-in LED on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense when the built-in push button is pressed.

The program sets up the built-in LED and push button. When the button is pressed, an interrupt runs a special function called an Interrupt Service Routine. The ISR is very short and only sets a flag variable \PYTHON{pushPressed} to \PYTHON{true}, indicating that the button has been pressed.

The main program \PYTHON{loop} checks this flag. If it is set to \PYTHON{true}, the program turns on the LED for 2 seconds, then turns it off and resets the flag to \PYTHON{false}. This ensures the system is ready to detect the next button press. Using the \PYTHON{true and false} values makes it easy to manage the button's state.

This method avoids constantly checking the button’s state, making the program more efficient. Additionally, the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense allows all its pins to be used for interrupts. This makes it easy to attach interrupt functions to any pin, allowing quick and efficient responses to inputs like buttons or sensors. \cite{ArduinoInterrupt:2019}

This is just a simple example. The variable \PYTHON{BUTTON\_B} is already defined, so the assignment is not necessary. The command \PYTHON{delay} should be avoided in an Arduino sketch. Instead, variables of the type \PYTHON{elapsedMillis} should be used.
