\chapter{Arduino Command Line Interface (CLI)}

Arduino Command Line Interface (CLI) is an all-in-one solution that provides Boards/Library Managers, sketch builder, board detection, uploader, and many other tools needed to use any Arduino compatible board and platform from command line or machine interfaces.
In addition to being a standalone tool, Arduino CLI is the heart of all official Arduino development software (Arduino IDE, Arduino Web Editor). This means that all functionalities provided by the development environment are also available here. This can be used under Windows, MacOS and Linux \cite{ArduinoCLIpro:2024}. Development using the command line interpreter makes it possible to carry out quality assurance measures in a targeted manner if batch files are used consistently. This means that the configuration of the development environment can be saved and repeated in a traceable manner.


The source code can be used freely, but a license must be requested from the company for commercial use \cite{ArduinoCLIGit:2024}. Detailed documentation is provided. \cite{ArduinoCLIDoc:2024}

The development of the Command Line Interface (CLI) focuses on three aspects.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item On the one hand, the interface can be embedded within familiar development tools, making it easier to work with platforms like Edge Impulse for machine learning at the edge.
	\item Secondly, it enables the integration of development into the Continuous Development and Continuous Integration processes. It thus enables the automation of typical software development activities.
	\item Furthermore, it now enables simplified communication with edge computers, for example with a Raspberry PI.
\end{enumerate}

\section {Installing and using the CLI}
As \ac{cli} is constantly being further developed, the current version must first be downloaded from the GitHub project \href{https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/0.36/installation/}{Arduino-cli-0.36-installation}, see \cite{ArduinoCLIGit:2024}. The version used here is 0.36.0 \cite{ArduinoCLIversion:2024}

\bigskip

After successfully downloading the file \FILE{arduino-cli\_1.0.4\_Windows\_64bit.zip}, the folder contents can be extracted to a self-defined storage path \PATH{C:/Program Files/Arduino CLI}. The packed file contains the license terms and the executable file \FILE{arduino-cli.exe}. 

In order to use the function of the command line interpreter in different paths, the path \PATH{C:/Program Files/Arduino CLI} to the storage location of the file \FILE{arduino-cli.exe} should be added to the system variable \SHELL{PATH} as shown in the below Figure ~\ref{Path}. The interface can then be used by entering \SHELL{arduino-cli} in the command line.

\begin{figure}

		\caption{Adding arduino-cli.exe file storage location to PATH system variable}
		\label{Path}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


After the installation is complete, \SHELL{arduino-cli board list} can be entered in the command prompt. The connected device is displayed as Arduino Portenta H7 with port number and type, as shown in Figure ~\ref{Installation}.  

\begin{figure}

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Arduino CLI License}

Arduino CLI is licensed under the GPL 3.0 license. The software is open-source and licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3, which means it is free to use, modify, and distribute it as long as you comply with the GPL terms. While there is typically a license file included in the download to explain the legal terms, but its presence is not required for the software to function. Buying a commercial license is mandatory if you want to modify or otherwise use the software for commercial activities involving the Arduino software without disclosing the source code of your own applications. \cite{ArduinoCLIGit:2024}


\section{Configuration of the Arduino CLI}

So that CLI can find the Arduino installation, it helps to create a configuration file for CLI. This configuration file is defined in a format \SHELL{YAML}. To create a basic configuration file, CLI can be used in which a command line
\SHELL{arduino-cli config init}
is entered. This command creates a new file \FILE{arduino-cli.yaml} in the following path \PATH{C:/Users/mselv/AppData/\\Local/Arduino15/arduino-cli.yaml}. All necessary parameters are declared there. The default settings of the configuration file are shown in the listing ~\ref{lst:yaml-config}. 

% Default settings of the configuration file
%\lstinputlisting[language=Python, firstline=1, %lastline=27]{../Code/Arduino/ArduinoCLI/yaml.py}


	
{
  \captionof{code}{Default settings of the configuration file}\label{lst:yaml-config}
  \YamlExternal{}{../../code/ArduinoCLI/default.yaml}  
}


The following parameters usually need to be changed:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \FILE{sketchbook\_path}: Directory of the Arduino sketchbook. All libraries and hardware definitions are installed here.
	\item \FILE{Arduino\_data}: Installation location of the Arduino board and the library manager. In most cases, this should not need to be changed.
\end{itemize}
The other options can generally remain at their default values.


\subsection{Configuration keys}

Configuration keys refer to the parameters or settings stored in the configuration file \FILE{arduino-cli.yaml}. These keys determine various aspects of how the Arduino CLI operates. \cite{ArduinoCLIConfig:2024}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \SHELL{board\_manager}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \SHELL{additional\_urls} - the URLs to any additional Boards Manager package index files needed for your boards platforms.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \SHELL{daemon} - options related to running Arduino CLI as a gRPC server.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \SHELL{port} - TCP port used for gRPC client connections.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \SHELL{directories} - directories used by Arduino CLI.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \SHELL{data} - directory used to store Boards/Library Manager index files and Boards Manager platform installations.
		\item \SHELL{downloads} - directory used to stage downloaded archives during Boards/Library Manager installations.
		\item \SHELL{user} - the equivalent of the Arduino IDE's "sketchbook" directory. Library Manager installations are made to the libraries subdirectory of the user directory.
		\item \SHELL{builtin.libraries} - the libraries in this directory will be available to all platforms without the need for the user to install them, but with the lowest priority over other installed libraries with the same name, it's the equivalent of the Arduino IDE's bundled libraries directory.
		\item \SHELL{builtin.tools} - it's a list of directories of tools that will be available to all platforms without the need for the user to install them, it's the equivalent of the Arduino IDE 1.x bundled tools directory.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \SHELL{library} - configuration options relating to Arduino libraries.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \SHELL{enable\_unsafe\_install} - set to true to enable the use of the --git-url and --zip-file flags with arduino-cli lib install. These are considered "unsafe" installation methods because they allow installing files that have not passed through the Library Manager submission process.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \SHELL{locale} - the language used by Arduino CLI to communicate to the user, the parameter is the language identifier in the standard POSIX format <language>[\_<TERRITORY>[.<encoding>]] (for example it or it\_IT, or it\_IT.UTF-8).
	\item \SHELL{logging} - configuration options for Arduino CLI's logs.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \SHELL{file} - path to the file where logs will be written.
		\item \SHELL{format} - output format for the logs. Allowed values are text or json.
		\item \SHELL{level} - messages with this level and above will be logged. Valid levels are: trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, panic.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \SHELL{metrics} - settings related to the collection of data used for continued improvement of Arduino CLI.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \SHELL{addr} - TCP port used for metrics communication.
		\item \SHELL{enabled} - controls the use of metrics.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \SHELL{output} - settings related to text output.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \SHELL{no\_color} - ANSI color escape codes are added by default to the output. Set to true to disable colored text output.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \SHELL{sketch} - configuration options relating to Arduino sketches.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \SHELL{always\_export\_binaries} - set to true to make arduino-cli compile always save binaries to the sketch folder. This is the equivalent of using the --export-binaries flag.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \SHELL{updater} - configuration options related to Arduino CLI updates
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \SHELL{enable\_notification} - set to false to disable notifications of new Arduino CLI releases, defaults to true
	\end{itemize}
	\item \SHELL{build\_cache} - configuration options related to the compilation cache
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \SHELL{compilations\_before\_purge} - interval, in number of compilations, at which the cache is purged, defaults to 10. When 0 the cache is never purged.
		\item \SHELL{ttl} - cache expiration time of build folders. If the cache is hit by a compilation the corresponding build files lifetime is renewed. The value format must be a valid input for time.ParseDuration(), defaults to 720h (30 days).
	\end{itemize}
	\item \SHELL{network} - configuration options related to the network connection.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \SHELL{proxy} - URL of the proxy server.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Configuration methods}
Arduino CLI may be configured in three ways:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Command line flags
	\item Environment variables
	\item Configuration file
\end{enumerate}

If a configuration option is configured by multiple methods, the value set by the method highest on the above list overwrites the ones below it.

If a configuration option is not set, Arduino CLI uses a default value.

\SHELL{arduino-cli config dump} displays the current configuration values. Detailed documentation is provided \cite{ArduinoCLIConfig:2024}

\subsubsection{Command line flags}
Configuration file of Arduino CLI can be modified using Command line flags. \cite{ArduinoCLIConfig:2024}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Example:
	Setting an additional Boards Manager URL using the \SHELL{--additional-urls} command line flag:
	\newline
	\PYTHON{arduino-cli core update-index --additional-urls}
	\newline
	\PYTHON{https://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package\_staging\_index.json}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Environment variables}
All configuration options can be set via environment variables. The variable names start with \SHELL{ARDUINO}, followed by the configuration key names, with each component separated by \SHELL{\_}. For example, the \SHELL{ARDUINO\_DIRECTORIES\_USER} environment variable sets the directories.user configuration option.
\\On Linux or macOS, you can use the \SHELL{export} command to set environment variables. On Windows command, you can use the \SHELL{set} command. \cite{ArduinoCLIConfig:2024}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Example:
	Setting an additional Boards Manager URL using the \SHELL{ARDUINO\_BOARD\_MANAGER\_ADDITIONAL\_URLS} environment variable:
	\newline
	\PYTHON{set ARDUINO\_BOARD\_MANAGER\_ADDITIONAL\_URLS=}
	\newline
	\PYTHON{https://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package\_staging\_index.json}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The export or set command should be run in terminal session. It sets the environment variable for the duration of that terminal session.
		\item If the terminal is closed, the environment variable will be unset. To make the variable persistent across terminal sessions, we should add the export or set command to shell's configuration file (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc, or .profile).
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Configuration file}
\SHELL{arduino-cli config init} creates or updates a configuration file with the current configuration settings.
This allows saving the options set by command line flags or environment variables. \cite{ArduinoCLIConfig:2024}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Example:
	\PYTHON{arduino-cli config init --additional-urls}
	\newline
	\PYTHON{https://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package\_staging\_index.json}
	\\The configuration file must be named \FILE{arduino-cli}, with the appropriate file extension for the file's format.
\end{itemize}

Refer the listing ~\ref{lst:yaml-config-upd}, for the updation of the configuration file using \SHELL{arduino-cli config init}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Basic functions}

The functions required to load a finished sketch onto an Arduino are defined as basic functions. Communication with a connected Arduino is implemented later using the serial monitor.

\bigskip
The first basic function is the board list command. This can be used to display all Arduino boards connected to the PC with additional information - such as the port used or the core of the board. This information is necessary for using the correct board.
The core list and core install commands are also required. The already installed cores can be listed with the core list command. If the core specified under board list is not installed, it can be added with the core install command.
The third basic function is the lib command with the lib list and lib install extensions. The lib list command can be used to check which libraries are already installed on the system. If an additional library is required for a sketch, it can be installed with the lib install command.

The preparations for compiling and uploading a sketch can be made with these basic functions. By executing the compile command, a sketch is compiled into code that can be read by a selected board. A compiled sketch is then uploaded to a board using the upload command. The port of the board known from the board list command is specified as the destination for the upload. The basic functions are summarized  in Table \ref{CLITableBasicFunction}

\begin{center}
	\begin{table}[h]
		\captionabove{List of Basic Functions}
		\begin{tabular}{c|c|l}
			No. & BasicFunction & Description \\ \hline
			1 & \SHELL{board list} & List the connected Arduinos with additional information \\
			2 & \SHELL{core list}/\SHELL{install} & List and install cores \\
			3 & \SHELL{lib list}/{install} & Listing and installing libraries \\
			4 & \SHELL{compile} & Compiling a sketch for a specific board \\
			5 & \SHELL{upload} & Uploading a sketch to an Arduino \\
		\end{tabular}
		\label{CLITableBasicFunction}
	\end{table}
\end{center}

\section{First steps with Arduino Portenta H7 using the CLI}

\subsection{Recognizing the connected boards}

CLI can be used to query which boards are installed using \SHELL{board listall}
\\
If the connected board is missing, it must be installed using \SHELL{core install}
\\
CLI can be used to query which boards are connected using \SHELL{board list}
\\
After the installation of the Arduino CLI and connecting the board to the PC, the command \SHELL{arduino-cli board list} can be used to check whether the board is recognized by the computer. The function \SHELL{board list} has several return values. The port via which the board is connected to the PC, the port, the type, the board name and the FQBN and core are returned, 
as shown in Figure ~\ref{CLIBoardList}. 
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Arduino/CLI/CLIBoardList.png}
		\caption{ Return values of the “board list” function }
		\label{CLIBoardList}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Configuration of Arduino CLI}

To begin with, the correct core for the Arduino Portenta H7 should be installed. Before that, add the staging index URL to the Arduino CLI configuration file \FILE{arduino-cli.yaml} with the following command \SHELL{arduino-cli config add board\_manager.additional\_urls \\https://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package\_staging\_\\index.json}. Then update the board index to fetch the latest package information from the staging index using the command \SHELL{arduino-cli core update-index} as shown in the Figure ~\ref{CoreIndex}.
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Arduino/CLI/CoreIndex.png}
		\caption{Updating the board index}
		\label{CoreIndex}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Arduino/CLI/CoreInstall.png}
		\caption{Installing the core for Arduino Portenta H7}
		\label{CoreInstall}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Once the index is updated, install the Portenta H7 boards core that are available in the staging index using the command \SHELL{arduino-cli core install arduino:mbed\_portenta} as shown in the Figure ~\ref{CoreInstall} and the correct core name "arduino:mbed" can be fetched from the Figure ~\ref{CLIBoardList}.
\begin{figure}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Arduino/CLI/Listall.png}
		\caption{List available boards}
		\label{Listall}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Now run the command \SHELL{arduino-cli board listall} to view all boards supported by the installed cores as shown in the Figure ~\ref{Listall}

\subsection{Creating a new sketch}
The first step is to create a new sketch:

\SHELL{arduino-cli sketch new cli\_test}

This command creates a directory named \FILE{cli\_test}, which contains a file with the same name as shown in the Figure ~\ref{NewSketch}

	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Arduino/CLI/NewSketch.png}
		\captionof{figure}{Creating a new Sketch with CLI}
		\label{NewSketch}
	\end{center}


\subsection{Compiling a sketch}
The function \SHELL{compile} of CLI can be used to compile a sketch for any supported board. The crucial option required by this function is the board type, which can be specified with the option \SHELL{--fqbn}. The abbreviation \SHELL{fqbn} means ``fully-qualified board name''. For example, the following boards are available:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Arduino Uno: \SHELL{arduino:avr:uno}
	\item Arduino Mega: \SHELL{arduino:avr:mega}
	\item Arduino Micro: \SHELL{arduino:avr:micro} 
	\item Arduino Mini: \SHELL{arduino:avr:mini}
	\item Arduino Portenta H7: \SHELL{arduino:mbed\_portenta}
	\item Arduino Portenta X8 : \SHELL{arduino:mbed\_portenta:portenta\_x8}
	\item ESP32 Dev Module: \SHELL{esp32:esp32}
\end{itemize}

The possible boards are structured as follows: 

\SHELL{manufacturer:architecture:board}

With the following command, the example sketch, which is located in the folder \FILE{C:/Users/user.name} can be compiled for an Arduino Portenta H7: 
\SHELL{arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:mbed\_portenta:envie\_m7 C:/Users/mselv/cli\_test}

\medskip

	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Arduino/CLI/CompileSketch.png}
		\captionof{figure}{Compiling a sketch with CLI }
		\label{CompileSketchCommand}
	\end{center}

Figure ~\ref{CompileSketchCommand} shows the CLI messages. The following flags can be added:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Verbose \SHELL{-v}: Useful if you want to display all options and files that are compiled in your sketch.
	\item Build path \SHELL{--build-path [string]}: Useful if the compiled object and hex files are to be saved in a custom path. On my Windows system, the value of this parameter must be a complete path.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Uploading a sketch}

A compiled sketch can be uploaded. Similar to the compile command, the upload command also requires the use of the option \SHELL{-fqbn}. Additionally, a serial interface is necessary for uploading, which is specified with the option \SHELL{-p}. The following command uploads the example sketch to a Windows COM port on COM18 as shown in Figure ~\ref{UploadSketchCLI}:

\SHELL{arduino-cli upload -p COM18 --fqbn arduino:mbed\_portenta:envie\_m7 C:/Users/mselv/cli\_test}


If executed correctly, the RX/TX LEDs of the Arduino should start flashing, and shortly afterward, an empty sketch will be executed.

\subsection{Installation of Libraries}

If a library is required, you can first use the command

\SHELL{arduino-cli lib search ethernet}

to check if the library (in this case, Ethernet) is installed. Then, with the command

\SHELL{arduino-cli lib install "UIPEthernet"}

you can install it.

\subsection{Example program ``Hello World''}

The "Hello World!" counterpart for microcontrollers will be used to demonstrate how to compile a sketch and then upload it using the Arduino CLI. A simple sketch that makes the Arduino's LED flash is used for this.

%\begin{code}
%	% Include a specific range of lines from the C++ file
%\lstinputlisting[language=C++, firstline=1, lastline=81, label={lst:arduinoBlink}]{../../Code/ArduinoCLI/Blink.ino}
%\end{code}

\medskip

{
\captionof{code}{Program ``Hello World'' for Arduino Portenta H7}
\ArduinoExternal{label={lst:arduinoBlink}}{../../Code/ArduinoCLI/Blink.ino}
}

\medskip

In the function \SHELL{setup()}, which is executed once at the beginning, the built-in LED is defined as an output \SHELL{pinMode(LED\_BUILTIN, OUTPUT)}. This allows the LED to be controlled later. Within the \SHELL{loop()} function, the LED is first switched on \SHELL{digitalWrite(LED\_BUILTIN, HIGH)} and then switched off again with a delay of one second \SHELL{delay(1000)}. Before the LED is switched on again at the beginning of the loop, another second is waited at the end of the loop to achieve the flashing effect.

To compile the sketch, the command previously defined as the basic function \SHELL{compile}, as shown in Figure \ref{CompileSketchCommand}, can be used.

The compiled sketch can then be uploaded to the Arduino Portenta H7 using the function \SHELL{upload} as shown in Figure ~\ref{UploadSketchCLI}


	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Arduino/CLI/UploadSketch.png}
		\captionof{figure}{Uploading the compiled sketch}
		\label{UploadSketchCLI}
	\end{center}


After the successful upload, the LED of the Arduino Portenta H7 shown in Figure \ref{LEDflash} starts to flash.

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Arduino/CLI/Blink.png}
	\captionof{figure}{The orange LED of the Arduino starts to flash}
	\label{LEDflash}
